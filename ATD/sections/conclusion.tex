\section{Conclusion}
The application is working as expected and, aside for the few issues presented in the Drawbacks section, all the features described in the ITD are present.
The user interface is clear and well organized and the user can easily and intuitively perform the few operations that are now accessible.
Future updates should focus on the implementation of the parts needed to make the user able to continue to use the application  after an SOS is sent and the change of credentials for the user.
