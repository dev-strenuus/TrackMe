\section{Conclusion}
QUALCOSA DI SIMILE A QUESTO\\
The application is working as expected and, aside for the few issues high-lighted above, all the features described in the ITD are present and usable.While this problems need to be addressed in future versions, they alsorepresent fringe cases that hinder the user experience in a marginal way,therefore, as of right now the application constitutes a working prototype.The user interface is clear and essential, and makes a positive impact thefirst time you open the application. The initial setup is a nice solution toillustrate the app functionalities and to gather and set user preferences.Future updates should focus on improving the ANONYMOUS REQUEST since this is one of the core features of the application.
