\section{Effort spent}
To realize this application we tried to equally distribute the effort. Each component of the group worked individually after having decided togheter what and how to implement and test with respect to the RASD document and the Design Document.
We all worked both on the back end and on the front end code.
We applied the same strategy to the writing of the ITD document.

Each of us worked about 120 hours.
