\section{Adopted Frameworks}

\subsection{Spring Boot}
Spring is a framework which provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications and Spring Boot is basically an extension of Spring which eliminated the boilerplate configurations required for setting up a Spring application.
In other words, while the Spring framework focuses on providing flexibility to you, Spring Boot aims to shorten the code length and provide you with the easiest way to develop a web application. With annotation configuration and default codes, Spring Boot shortens the time involved in developing an application. It helps create a stand-alone application with less or almost zero-configuration.\\

\textbf{Why Spring Boot?}
\begin{itemize}
\item To ease the Java-based applications Development, Unit Test and Integration Test Process.
\item To reduce Development, Unit Test and Integration Test time by providing some defaults.
\item To increase Productivity.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why Spring?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Spring is a light weight framework and It minimally invasive development with POJO.
\item Spring achieves the loose coupling through dependency injection and interface based programming.
\item Spring supports declarative programming through aspects and common conventions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Inversion of Control}\\
Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering by which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. Itâ€™s most often used in the context of object-oriented programming.

By contrast with traditional programming, in which our custom code makes calls to a library, IoC enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code. To enable this, frameworks use abstractions with additional behavior built in. If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.

The advantages of this architecture are:
\begin{itemize}
\item decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
\item making it easier to switch between different implementations
\item greater modularity of a program
\item greater ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking its dependencies and allowing components to communicate through contracts
\end{itemize}

Inversion of Control can be achieved through various mechanisms such as: Strategy design pattern, Service Locator pattern, Factory pattern, and Dependency Injection (DI).
