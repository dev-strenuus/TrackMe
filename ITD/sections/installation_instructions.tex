\subsection{Individual Client}
 To let the Individual face a mobile experience, we used the open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development Ionic, built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova.\\	Installing Cordova or Ionic requires Node and npm installed on your machine. \\If you have not, in case of macOs please install brew and then run the command :\\
 - \textit{brew install node} if you did not already have Node and npm installed on your computer.\\
After installing Node, run the following command to install Ionic:\\
- \textit{npm install -g cordova ionic}\\
To test our App in real time we used PhoneGap, that is a free and open source framework that allows to create mobile apps using standardized web APIs.\\No need for any sort of compiling or building before testing. All we need is to place our machine and our device on the same network.\\
To install PhoneGap, please run the command:\\
- \textit{npm install -g phonegap}\\
Finally, enter the ionicApp/TrackMe folder and run:\\
- \textit{phonegap serve}\\
Installing the PhoneGap application on your smartphone you will be able to start your session inserting IP and port.
