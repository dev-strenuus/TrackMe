	\underline{\textbf{Introduction} }
	\begin{legal}
    		\item \textit{\textbf{Purpose}}\\\\
		This document is thought to be an overview of the TrackMe application, in which is explained how to satisfy the several project requirements stated in the RASD. This document is principally intended for the developers and the testers, with the purpose of providing a functional description of the main architectural components, their interfaces and their interactions, along with the design patterns.
		\item \textit{\textbf{Scope}}\\\\
		---Presentation---\\ 
		TrackMe is structured in a multi-tier architecture. More specifically, the Business logic layer has the task of taking charge of the incoming requests/data, computing checks, and interacting with external third-party services through the use of interfaces. This layer is connected with the Data layer, in which are stored all the Users data (credentials, health data). The Presentation layer is build through the fat Client paradigm in which the client needs to perform computation to temporarily store health data in the local memory in case of missing internet connection between the client and the server.

		\item \textit{\textbf{Document structure}}\\\\
		The following document is organised in this way:
		\begin{itemize}
				\item Architectural Design: this section shows the main components of the system and the connections among them. It will also focus on design choices, styles and patterns.
				\item User Interface Design: this section includes an improvement of the user interface given in the RASD document. It will be described through the use of UX modeling.
				\item Requirements Traceability: this section shows how the requirements in the RASD are mapped to the design components presented in the DD;
				\item Implementation, Integration and Test plan: this section shows the order in which the implementation and the integration of the subcomponents will occur and how the integration will be tested.
			\end{itemize}
